      overview: "A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows you to save money for retirement while reducing your current taxable income. Understanding how 401k contributions, employer matching, and compound growth work together is essential for building long-term wealth.",

          title: "Tax-Deferred Growth",

        {
          title: "Employer Matching", 
          content: "Many employers offer matching contributions, essentially free money for your retirement. Common matches include dollar-for-dollar up to 3% or 50 cents per dollar up to 6% of your salary."
        },

          title: "Contribution Limits",
          content: "For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 annually ($30,500 if age 50 or older with catch-up contributions). These limits help maximize your tax-advantaged savings."
        },
        {
          title: "Investment Options",
          content: "401k plans typically offer mutual funds, index funds, and target-date funds. Diversifying your investments and considering low-cost options can significantly impact long-term growth."
